---

## Installation

The Java SDK is available as a [Maven dependency](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.ably/ably-java). To get started with your project, install the package:

### Install for Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.ably</groupId>
    <artifactId>ably-java</artifactId>
    <version>1.3.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Install for Gradle:

```gradle
implementation 'io.ably:ably-java:1.3.0'
implementation 'org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:2.0.7'
```

Run the following to instantiate a client:

```java
import io.ably.lib.realtime.AblyRealtime;
import io.ably.lib.types.ClientOptions;

ClientOptions options = new ClientOptions(apiKey);
AblyRealtime realtime = new AblyRealtime(options);
```

---

## Usage

The following code connects to Ably's realtime messaging service, subscribes to a channel to receive messages, and publishes a test message to that same channel.


```java
// Initialize Ably Realtime client
ClientOptions options = new ClientOptions("your-ably-api-key");
options.clientId = "me";
AblyRealtime realtimeClient = new AblyRealtime(options);

// Wait for connection to be established
realtimeClient.connection.on(ConnectionEvent.connected, connectionStateChange -> {
    System.out.println("Connected to Ably");
    
    // Get a reference to the 'test-channel' channel
    Channel channel = realtimeClient.channels.get("test-channel");
    
    // Subscribe to all messages published to this channel
    channel.subscribe(message -> {
        System.out.println("Received message: " + message.data);
    });
    
    // Publish a test message to the channel
    channel.publish("test-event", "hello world");
});
```

## Live Objects

Ably Live Objects provide realtime, collaborative data structures that automatically synchronize state across all connected clients. Build interactive applications with shared data that updates instantly across devices.

### Installation

Add the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    runtimeOnly("io.ably:liveobjects:1.3.0")
}
```

### Documentation and Examples

- **[Live Objects Documentation](https://ably.com/docs/liveobjects)** - Complete guide to using Live Objects with code examples and API reference
- **[Example App](./examples)** - Interactive demo showcasing Live Objects with realtime color voting and collaborative task management

The example app demonstrates:
- **Color Voting**: Realtime voting system with live vote counts synchronized across all devices
- **Task Management**: Collaborative task management where users can add, edit, and delete tasks that sync in realtime

To run the example app, follow the setup instructions in the [examples README](./examples/README.md).

## Proxy support

You can add proxy support to the Ably Java SDK by configuring `ProxyOptions` in your client setup, enabling connectivity through corporate firewalls and secured networks.

<details>
<summary>Proxy support setup details.</summary>

To enable proxy support for both REST and Realtime clients in the Ably SDK, use the OkHttp library to handle HTTP requests and WebSocket connections.

Add the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    runtimeOnly("io.ably:network-client-okhttp:1.3.0")
}
```

After adding the OkHttp dependency, enable proxy support by specifying proxy settings in the ClientOptions when initializing your Ably client.

The following example sets up a proxy using the Pub/Sub Java SDK:

```java
import io.ably.lib.realtime.AblyRealtime;
import io.ably.lib.rest.AblyRest;
import io.ably.lib.transport.Defaults;
import io.ably.lib.types.ClientOptions;
import io.ably.lib.types.ProxyOptions;
import io.ably.lib.http.HttpAuth;

public class AblyWithProxy {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Configure Ably Client options
        ClientOptions options = new ClientOptions();
        
        // Setup proxy settings
        ProxyOptions proxy = new ProxyOptions();
        proxy.host = "your-proxy-host";  // Replace with your proxy host
        proxy.port = 8080;               // Replace with your proxy port
        
        // Optional: If the proxy requires authentication
        proxy.username = "your-username";  // Replace with proxy username
        proxy.password = "your-password";  // Replace with proxy password
        proxy.prefAuthType = HttpAuth.Type.BASIC;  // Choose your preferred authentication type (e.g., BASIC or DIGEST)

        // Attach the proxy settings to the client options
        options.proxy = proxy;

        // Create an instance of Ably using the configured options
        AblyRest ably = new AblyRest(options);

        // Alternatively, for real-time connections
        AblyRealtime ablyRealtime = new AblyRealtime(options);

        // Use the Ably client as usual
    }
}
```
