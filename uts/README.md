## 1. Introduction: What is UTS?

**UTS (Universal Test Specification)** is Ably's language-neutral catalogue of tests for its client
SDKs. The problem it solves: Ably ships many SDKs (JavaScript, Dart, Kotlin/Java, Swift, Go, …), and
every one of them must obey the *same* behavioural contract — the **Ably features spec**
(`specification/specifications/features.md`, whose requirements are tagged `RSC7`, `RTN15a`, `RTL4f`,
etc.). Without a shared test definition, each SDK would re-invent its own tests, drift apart, and
leave gaps.

UTS fixes this by separating **what to test** from **how to test it in a given language**:

```
        ┌──────────────────────────────┐
        │   Ably features spec          │   ← the ultimate authority (RSC*, RTN*, RTL* …)
        │   (features.md)               │
        └──────────────┬───────────────┘
                       │ distilled into portable test specs
                       ▼
        ┌──────────────────────────────┐
        │   UTS test specs (.md)        │   ← language-neutral pseudocode, one file per feature
        │   "writing-test-specs"        │     e.g. realtime/unit/connection/connection_recovery_test.md
        └──────────────┬───────────────┘
                       │ translated ("derived") per SDK
                       ▼
        ┌──────────────────────────────┐
        │   Derived tests               │   ← concrete, runnable tests in the SDK's language
        │   (this repo: Kotlin in uts/) │     e.g. ConnectionRecoveryTest.kt
        └──────────────────────────────┘
```

Three concepts you will see constantly:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Spec point** | A tagged requirement in the features spec, e.g. `RTN16g`, `RTN22`, `RTL4f`. Test names embed these. |
| **UTS spec** | A markdown file of portable pseudocode describing the setup, steps, and assertions for one feature. The *source of truth for what to test.* |
| **Derived test** | A faithful translation of a UTS spec into a real test in a specific SDK/language. This is what lives in `ably-java/uts/`. |
| **Deviation** | A documented case where the SDK's actual behaviour diverges from the spec. Recorded in `deviations.md`. |

The golden rule (from [`writing-derived-tests.md`](https://github.com/ably/specification/blob/main/uts/docs/writing-derived-tests.md)): **translate the UTS spec faithfully** — same
structure, same assertions, same naming — don't optimise or skip steps. Every derived test carries a
`// UTS: <id>` (here `@UTS …`) comment linking it back to its spec.

---

## 2. The Three Test Tiers

UTS divides tests into three tiers by *what infrastructure they need* and *what confidence they
give*. Understanding this split is the key to understanding the whole `uts/` module, because the two
tests you asked about sit in two different tiers.

| Tier | Transport | Backend | Purpose | Example in this repo |
|------|-----------|---------|---------|----------------------|
| **Unit** | **Mocked** (`MockWebSocket`, `MockHttpClient`) | none | Client-side logic: state machines, request formation, response parsing, timer behaviour. Fast & deterministic. | `unit/connection/ConnectionRecoveryTest.kt` |
| **Direct sandbox integration** | Real network | Real Ably sandbox | Happy-path interop: connect, publish, subscribe. No fault injection. | *(not in the two you asked about)* |
| **Proxy integration** | Real network **through a programmable proxy** | Real Ably sandbox | Fault behaviour: dropped connections, injected errors, timeouts, re-auth. | `integration/proxy/AuthReauthTest.kt` |

Key principles (from [`integration-testing.md`](https://github.com/ably/specification/blob/main/uts/docs/integration-testing.md)):

- **Integration tests do not replace unit tests.** A spec point covered by a proxy test should
  *also* have a unit test. The unit test proves the client logic; the proxy test proves the client
  and the real server agree.
- **Proxy tests prefer "late fault injection".** Let the real handshake complete against the real
  server, *then* inject the fault as the final interaction. This maximises how much of the test
  exercises genuine client-server behaviour (otherwise you've just written a slow unit test).
- **Proxy tests always use JSON** (`useBinaryProtocol = false`). The spec corpus gives two reasons:
  the proxy only supports **text** WebSocket frames so it can't inspect/modify msgpack
  ([`integration-testing.md`](https://github.com/ably/specification/blob/main/uts/docs/integration-testing.md) §Protocol Variants), and the SDK under test doesn't implement msgpack
  ([`helpers/proxy.md`](https://github.com/ably/specification/blob/main/uts/realtime/integration/helpers/proxy.md)).

## 3. The UTS Documents (the source of truth)

These four documents live in the **specification repo** at
[`uts/docs/`](https://github.com/ably/specification/blob/main/uts/docs/) (in a local
`ably-specification` checkout, under `specification/uts/docs/`). They are the policy/authoring guides;
the Kotlin code in this repo is the *implementation* of what they describe. Each title below links to
the file on GitHub.

### 3.1 [`writing-test-specs.md`](https://github.com/ably/specification/blob/main/uts/docs/writing-test-specs.md) — how to author a portable UTS spec
The authoring manual. Defines:
- **Test types** (unit / integration / proxy) and when each applies.
- **Test IDs** — the format `<category>/<spec-point>/<descriptive-name>-<n>`, e.g.
  `realtime/proxy/RTN22/server-initiated-reauth-0`. These IDs are what appear in the `@UTS`
  comments in the Kotlin tests.
- **Mock infrastructure pseudocode interfaces** — `MockHttpClient`, `MockWebSocket`,
  `PendingConnection`, `PendingRequest`, with `respond_with_success()`, `send_to_client()`,
  `simulate_disconnect()`, etc. The Kotlin classes in `uts/infra/` are direct realisations of these
  interfaces.
- **Handler vs await patterns** for mocks (see §6).
- **WebSocket closing semantics** — the crucial rule: `send_to_client_and_close()` for
  DISCONNECTED / connection-level ERROR (server closes the socket); `send_to_client()` for a
  channel-level ERROR (connection stays open).
- **Anti-flake conventions** — no fixed `WAIT`s; use polling, `AWAIT_STATE`, fake timers, and the
  **record-and-verify** pattern (`CONTAINS_IN_ORDER`) for transient states.

### 3.2 [`writing-derived-tests.md`](https://github.com/ably/specification/blob/main/uts/docs/writing-derived-tests.md) — how to translate a spec into a real SDK test
The translation manual. Two phases:
1. **Translation** (always): faithfully render the spec into the target language; map pseudocode to
   the SDK's API and test framework; flag ambiguities in comments; make sure it compiles.
2. **Evaluation** (when an implementation exists): run the test and, if it fails, work the
   **decision tree**:
   - *Is the UTS spec wrong* (contradicts features spec)? → fix the test, record a **UTS spec error**.
   - *Is the translation wrong*? → fix the test, no deviation.
   - *Is the SDK non-compliant*? → keep the spec-correct assertion but adapt/gate it, and record a
     **deviation**.
- Defines the **env-gated skip** pattern (`RUN_DEVIATIONS`) — the test holds the *spec-correct*
  assertion but only runs it when the env var is set, so normal runs stay green while each deviation
  stays individually reproducible. This is exactly what `ConnectionRecoveryTest` uses for RTN16f.

### 3.3 [`integration-testing.md`](https://github.com/ably/specification/blob/main/uts/docs/integration-testing.md) — the policy for integration & proxy tests
Defines what *deserves* an integration test (request/response interop, error interop, data
round-trips, stateful protocol sequences), the directory layout, sandbox provisioning, proxy session
lifecycle, timeout strategy, and the **late-fault-injection** philosophy. The `integration/proxy/`
segregation exists because proxy tests have different infra needs, CI cadence, and failure modes.

### 3.4 [`completion-status.md`](https://github.com/ably/specification/blob/main/uts/docs/completion-status.md) — the coverage matrix
A big table mapping every features-spec group (`RSC`, `RTN`, `RTL`, `RTP`, …) to the UTS specs that
cover it, with a per-tier summary (`unit:✓ proxy:✓`). This is the tracker for "what's done and
what's missing". The two tests you asked about correspond to these rows:
- `RTN16` (connection recovery) → unit spec `connection_recovery_test.md` → **`ConnectionRecoveryTest.kt`**.
- `RTN22` / `RTC8a` (server-initiated re-auth) → proxy spec
  `realtime/integration/proxy/auth_reauth.md` → **`AuthReauthTest.kt`**.

> There is also a fifth, *referenced* spec:
> [`realtime/integration/helpers/proxy.md`](https://github.com/ably/specification/blob/main/uts/realtime/integration/helpers/proxy.md)
> (in the spec repo under `uts/realtime/integration/helpers/`). It defines the proxy's control API, rule format,
> action types, and the **protocol message action-number table** (CONNECTED=4, ATTACH=10, AUTH=17,
> …). The Kotlin `ProxySession` is the client for exactly that API.

---

## 4. The Java Setup: the `uts/` module

The `uts/` directory is a **standalone Gradle module** (`include("uts")` in
`settings.gradle.kts`) whose only job is to host UTS-derived tests. It contains *no production code* —
everything lives under `uts/src/test/`.

### 4.1 `uts/build.gradle.kts`
```kotlin
plugins { alias(libs.plugins.kotlin.jvm) }

dependencies {
    testImplementation(project(":java"))                 // the SDK under test
    testImplementation(project(":network-client-core"))  // HttpEngine / WebSocketEngine interfaces
    testImplementation(kotlin("test"))
    testImplementation(libs.mockk)
    testImplementation(libs.coroutine.core)              // kotlinx.coroutines
    testImplementation(libs.coroutine.test)              // runTest, virtual time
    testImplementation(libs.ktor.client.core)            // HTTP client for proxy/sandbox control
    testImplementation(libs.ktor.client.cio)
}

tasks.withType<Test>().configureEach {
    useJUnitPlatform()                                   // JUnit 5
    jvmArgs("--add-opens", "java.base/java.time=ALL-UNNAMED")
    jvmArgs("--add-opens", "java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED")
    // Propagate a local proxy build override (see ProxyManager):
    systemProperty("uts.proxy.localPath", /* -Duts.proxy.localPath=… or $UTS_PROXY_LOCAL_PATH */ …)
}
```
Takeaways:
- Tests are **Kotlin + JUnit 5**, using **kotlinx.coroutines** for async control and **Ktor** as the
  HTTP client that talks to the sandbox REST API and the proxy control API.
- It depends on `:java` (the SDK) and `:network-client-core` (the pluggable transport interfaces the
  mocks implement).
- The `--add-opens java.base/java.time` and `java.base/java.lang` flags grant reflective access into
  those JDK packages for the test runtime. They mirror the same flags set in `java/build.gradle.kts`
  for the SDK's own test module (which additionally opens `java.net` and `java.lang.reflect`).
- A system property carries an optional path to a **locally built** proxy binary (so you can test
  against an unreleased proxy).

```

The mental model: **`uts/infra/` powers unit tests, `test/helper/` powers proxy tests, and `Utils.kt`
serves both.**

## 5. How a Test Reaches the SDK: the hook points

A test can only mock transports because the SDK was designed with **pluggable seams**. They live on
`io.ably.lib.debug.DebugOptions` (a subclass of `ClientOptions`):

```java
public class DebugOptions extends ClientOptions {
    public HttpEngine httpEngine;                       // ← MockHttpClient installs here
    public WebSocketEngineFactory webSocketEngineFactory; // ← MockWebSocket installs here
    public Clock clock;                                 // ← FakeClock installs here
    …
}
```

and the `Clock` interface:

```java
public interface Clock {
    long currentTimeMillis();
    long nanoTime();
    AblyTimer newTimer(String name);                    // every SDK timer is created through this
    void waitOn(Object target, long timeout) throws InterruptedException; // every blocking wait
}
```

So the recipe is:
- Want to fake the **WebSocket**? Set `webSocketEngineFactory` to a factory that produces a mock
  engine.
- Want to fake **HTTP**? Set `httpEngine` to a mock engine.
- Want to control **time** (timeouts, retries, TTL expiry) deterministically? Set `clock` to a
  `FakeClock`.

The `ClientOptionsBuilder` (next section) wraps all three so tests never touch `DebugOptions`
directly.

---

## 6. Unit-Test Infrastructure (mocked transports)

### 6.1 The client builder — `ClientFactories.kt`
Every unit test builds its client through a tiny DSL:

```kotlin
class ClientOptionsBuilder : DebugOptions("appId.keyId:keySecret") {
    init { useBinaryProtocol = false }                  // JSON so mocks can decode frames
    fun install(mock: MockWebSocket) = mock.installOn(this)
    fun install(mock: MockHttpClient) = mock.installOn(this)
    fun enableFakeTimers(fakeClock: FakeClock) { clock = fakeClock }
}

fun TestRealtimeClient(block: ClientOptionsBuilder.() -> Unit): AblyRealtime =
    AblyRealtime(ClientOptionsBuilder().apply(block))
fun TestRestClient(block: ClientOptionsBuilder.() -> Unit): AblyRest =
    AblyRest(ClientOptionsBuilder().apply(block))
```

- It seeds a **dummy API key** (`appId.keyId:keySecret`) — fine, because unit tests never hit a real
  server and tokens are opaque.
- It forces **JSON** so the mock can parse protocol frames.
- `install(mock)` / `enableFakeTimers(clock)` wire the seams from §5.

A typical unit test reads:
```kotlin
val mock = MockWebSocket { onConnectionAttempt = { it.respondWithSuccess(CONNECTED_MESSAGE) } }
val client = TestRealtimeClient {
    autoConnect = false
    install(mock)
}
```

### 6.2 `MockWebSocket` — the fake realtime transport
This is the heart of realtime unit testing. It plugs into the SDK via
`MockWebSocketEngineFactory` (which implements the SDK's `WebSocketEngineFactory` SPI from
`network-client-core`), and exposes two complementary control styles:

**(a) Callback style** — handle inline, synchronously on the SDK thread. Set fields on
`WebSocketMockConfig`:
```kotlin
val mock = MockWebSocket {
    onConnectionAttempt = { conn -> conn.respondWithSuccess(CONNECTED_MESSAGE) }
    onMessageFromClient  = { msg -> /* inspect frames the SDK sent */ }
}
```
Best when every connection attempt should behave the same way.

**(b) Await style** — suspend until the SDK triggers something, then respond. Leave the callbacks
null and call the `await*` methods:
```kotlin
val pending = mock.awaitConnectionAttempt()      // suspend until SDK opens a socket
pending.respondWithRefused()                     // …then decide how to answer
val frame = mock.awaitNextMessageFromClient()    // suspend until SDK sends a frame
```
Required when the *first* connection and a *reconnection* need different answers (e.g.
"connect succeeds, then all retries are refused" — exactly the SUSPENDED scenario in the unit test).

> ⚠️ You cannot mix the two styles for the same event type — a callback consumes the event before the
> queue ever sees it.

**Server → client direction** (driving the SDK), matching the spec's closing semantics:

| Method | What it does | Use for |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| `sendToClient(msg)` | deliver a frame, connection stays open | CONNECTED, ATTACHED, channel-level ERROR, normal messages |
| `sendToClientAndClose(msg)` | deliver a frame then close (code 1000) | DISCONNECTED, connection-level ERROR (fatal) |
| `simulateDisconnect()` | close with code 1006, no message | unexpected network drop → triggers DISCONNECTED/resume |

**Everything is logged.** `mock.events` is an ordered `List<MockEvent>` (a sealed class in
`MockEvent.kt`: `ConnectionAttempt`, `ConnectionEstablished`, `ConnectionRefused`, `SentToClient`,
`MessageFromClient`, `ClientClose`, `Disconnected`, …). Tests assert against it, e.g.
`mock.events.filterIsInstance<MockEvent.ConnectionAttempt>().size`.

**`CONNECTED_MESSAGE`** is a ready-to-use CONNECTED `ProtocolMessage` (connectionId
`test-connection-id`, a connection key, TTL 120 s, max-idle 15 s) so most tests don't hand-build it.
(It is a `val` with a custom getter, so each access returns a **fresh** instance — not a shared
singleton; safe to mutate per test, e.g. `CONNECTED_MESSAGE.apply { … }`.)

One subtlety encoded in `DefaultPendingConnection.respondWithSuccess(message)`: the CONNECTED frame is
delivered **asynchronously** on a separate `mock-ws-delivery` thread. That mirrors reality — the SDK
must store the WebSocket reference *before* it processes CONNECTED, so the mock must not deliver it
synchronously inside the connect call.

### 6.3 `MockHttpClient` — the fake REST transport
The HTTP analogue, plugged in via `MockHttpEngine` (implements the SDK's `HttpEngine` SPI). Same two
styles (`onConnectionAttempt`/`onRequest` callbacks, or `awaitConnectionAttempt()`/`awaitRequest()`).
A request flows in two phases inside `MockHttpCall.execute()`:
1. **Connect phase** → produces a `PendingConnection` (`respondWithSuccess/Refused/Timeout/DnsError`).
2. **Request phase** → produces a `PendingRequest` exposing `url`, `method`, `headers`, `body`, and
   `respondWith(status, body, headers)` / `respondWithDelay(...)` / `respondWithTimeout()`.

This lets REST unit tests assert on outgoing request shape (path, headers, query) and feed canned
responses back — all without a socket.

### 6.4 `FakeClock` — deterministic time
`FakeClock` implements the SDK's `Clock`. Time is frozen until you call `advance(ms)`; on each
advance it fires any due virtual timers **synchronously**, and wakes any `waitOn` sleepers. This is
how the unit test drives reconnection backoff and `connectionStateTtl` expiry **without real
sleeping**:
```kotlin
val fakeClock = FakeClock()
val client = TestRealtimeClient { enableFakeTimers(fakeClock); … }
…
fakeClock.advance(2.seconds)      // jump forward; due timers fire now
```
`pendingTaskCount(timerName)` lets you assert how many tasks are scheduled — useful for verifying
retry state.

## 7. Proxy-Integration Infrastructure (real backend + fault injection)

Proxy tests connect the **real SDK** to the **real Ably sandbox**, but route the traffic through a
small Go program — [`ably/uts-proxy`](https://github.com/ably/uts-proxy) — that can be told to inject
faults. Three Kotlin helpers make this work.

### 7.1 `ProxyManager` — gets the proxy binary running
A singleton (`object`) responsible for the proxy *process*:
- Pins a proxy version (`v0.3.0`) and knows the **SHA-256 checksums** for each
  OS/arch archive.
- `ensureProxy()` (called in `@BeforeAll`) is idempotent: if a proxy is already healthy on the
  control port (**10100**) it's a no-op; otherwise it **downloads** the right
  `uts-proxy_<ver>_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz` from GitHub releases, **verifies the checksum**, extracts the
  binary with a hand-rolled tar/gzip reader (JDK-only, no extra deps), caches it under
  `~/.cache/uts-proxy/<version>/`, and launches it with `--port 10100`.
- The download is serialised **across JVMs** by a `FileLock` and **within a JVM** by a `Mutex`.
  Because process startup shares the control port, `ProxyManager`'s KDoc **advises** running proxy
  suites single-fork (`maxParallelForks = 1`) to avoid two Gradle workers racing to bind the control
  port. ⚠️ Note: this is currently only a documented recommendation — it is **not** set in
  `uts/build.gradle.kts`. With a single proxy test class today the race is not yet triggered, but it
  should be configured before a second proxy suite is added.
- A **JVM shutdown hook** force-kills the spawned process on exit (a `ProcessBuilder` child does not
  die with its parent).
- Override knob: set `-Duts.proxy.localPath=…` or `$UTS_PROXY_LOCAL_PATH` to use a **locally built**
  proxy binary or `.tar.gz` (skips download + checksum). The build script forwards this property
  into the test JVM.

### 7.2 `ProxySession` — one test's window into the proxy
The proxy exposes a **control REST API** on the control port; `ProxySession` is the typed Kotlin
client for it (via Ktor). One session per test.

- `ProxySession.create(rules, …)` → `POST /sessions` with a `target` (the sandbox realtime/REST
  hosts) and an initial **rule list**; the proxy assigns a `sessionId` and a fresh **listening
  port**.
- `addRules(rules, position)` → add rules mid-test (`POST /sessions/{id}/rules`).
- `triggerAction(action)` → fire an **imperative** action *right now* (`POST
  /sessions/{id}/actions`) — e.g. inject a frame or drop the connection at a precise moment.
- `getLog()` → `GET /sessions/{id}/log`, returning a typed `List<Event>`. Each `Event` carries
  `type` (`ws_connect`, `ws_frame`, `http_request`, …), `direction`, `queryParams`, and the parsed
  protocol `message` (a `JsonObject`, introspected via `message?.get("action")?.asInt`).
- `close()` → `DELETE /sessions/{id}`, always called in a `finally`.

**Rules** = `match` + `action` (+ optional `times`). Builder helpers keep tests readable:
`wsConnectRule`, `wsFrameToClientRule`, `wsFrameToServerRule`, `httpRequestRule`. Rules evaluate in
order, first match wins, unmatched traffic passes through, and `times: N` auto-removes a rule after N
firings. Common actions: `refuse_connection`, `suppress`, `replace`, `inject_to_client[_and_close]`,
`disconnect`, `http_respond`.

**Wiring the client to the proxy** — the `connectThroughProxy(session)` extension does exactly what
the proxy spec prescribes:
```kotlin
fun ClientOptionsBuilder.connectThroughProxy(session: ProxySession) {
    realtimeHost = session.proxyHost   // "localhost"
    restHost     = session.proxyHost
    port         = session.proxyPort   // the session's assigned port
    tls          = false               // proxy serves plain HTTP/WS; TLS is only upstream
}
```
Explicit hosts auto-disable fallback hosts (REC2c2), so no `fallbackHosts` juggling is needed.

### 7.3 `SandboxApp` — a throwaway app on the real sandbox
Provisioning helper for the real backend (provisioned **directly**, not through the proxy, so it's
independent of the fault rules):
- `SandboxApp.create()` fetches the canonical `test-app-setup.json` from `ably-common`,
  `POST`s it to `https://sandbox.realtime.ably-nonprod.net/apps`, and exposes `appId`, `defaultKey`
  (full-capability `appId.keyId:keySecret`), and the full `keys` list.
- `delete()` removes the app in teardown (best-effort — errors are swallowed since sandbox apps
  auto-expire).
- The Ktor client retries only **idempotent GETs** (never re-POSTs `/apps`, to avoid duplicate
  apps).

## 8. Shared Async Helpers

`Utils.kt` provides the coroutine glue both tiers rely on. All three run on a **single-thread real
dispatcher** so their timeouts measure **wall-clock** time (not the virtual time of
`kotlinx.coroutines.test`). The two state-waiters (`awaitState`/`awaitChannelState`) register their
listener *before* checking current state, to avoid a check-then-register race; `pollUntil` has no
listener — it re-evaluates the predicate every `interval` until it holds or the timeout fires.

| Helper | Signature | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `awaitState` | `(client, target, timeout=5s)` | suspend until `connection.state == target` (or already there) |
| `awaitChannelState` | `(channel, target, timeout=5s)` | same, for a channel's state |
| `pollUntil` | `(timeout=15s, interval=100ms) { condition }` | suspend until a boolean predicate holds — used in proxy tests to wait on real network/proxy state, e.g. `pollUntil { authCallbackCount.get() > original }` |

`types/Utils.kt` adds one tiny convenience: a `ConnectionDetails { … }` builder DSL so tests can write
`ConnectionDetails { connectionKey = "key-1"; connectionStateTtl = 120000L }`.

## 9. Walkthrough: the Unit Test (`ConnectionRecoveryTest`)

**File:** `uts/.../realtime/unit/connection/ConnectionRecoveryTest.kt`
**Tier:** Unit (mocked WebSocket, no network).
**Spec area:** RTN16 — connection recovery via the `recover` option and `createRecoveryKey()`.

It contains six tests; each carries an `@UTS realtime/unit/RTN16…/…` tag. Here's what each proves and
the technique it uses:

### 9.1 `RTN16g, RTN16g1` — recovery-key structure (incl. Unicode)
Connects (mock returns CONNECTED with a known key), attaches two channels — one ASCII, one Unicode
(`channel-éàü-世界`) — feeding each an `ATTACHED` with a `channelSerial` via `sendToClient`. Then calls
`connection.createRecoveryKey()`, decodes it with `RecoveryKeyContext.decode`, and asserts the
connection key, `msgSerial == 0`, and both channel serials survive — including a full
**encode→decode round-trip** to prove the Unicode name isn't corrupted (RTN16g1).
*Technique: callback-style `onConnectionAttempt`, `sendToClient` for ATTACHED, `awaitChannelState`.*

### 9.2 `RTN16g2` — `createRecoveryKey()` returns null in inactive states
The most elaborate test — it walks the connection through **five** states and asserts the key is null
in each inactive one:
- **INITIALIZED** (before connect) → null.
- **CONNECTED** → non-null (sanity).
- **CLOSING / CLOSED** → null (close nulls the key immediately).
- **FAILED** → null. *(Contains a documented **deviation** — see §11: the spec's fatal error
  code 50000/500 isn't treated as fatal by the SDK, and `send_to_client_and_close` races the FAILED
  transition; the test uses code 40000/400 and plain `sendToClient`.)*
- **SUSPENDED** → null. Built with a `FakeClock`: connect succeeds, then `simulateDisconnect()`,
  then a coroutine **refuses every reconnection attempt** while `fakeClock.advance(2.seconds)` loops
  until the short `connectionStateTtl` (800 ms) expires and the client gives up to SUSPENDED.
*Technique: this is the textbook example of **await-style** mocking — the first connection succeeds
via `awaitConnectionAttempt()`, but reconnections need the *refused* response, so a separate
`refuseJob` coroutine drives them; mixing this with fake timers gives deterministic SUSPENDED.*

### 9.3 `RTN16k` — `recover` adds the `recover` query param
Constructs the client with `recover = <recoveryKey>`, captures `conn.queryParams` on each connection
attempt, then `simulateDisconnect()` and reconnect. Asserts the **first** attempt carries
`recover=<key>` (and no `resume`), while the **second** (post-reconnect) carries `resume=<new key>`
(and no `recover`) — i.e. recover is a one-shot bootstrap, subsequent reconnections use resume.

### 9.4 `RTN16f` — `recover` initialises `msgSerial` *(env-gated deviation)*
Asserts the recovered `msgSerial` (42) is preserved. The SDK resets it to 0, so the spec-correct
assertion `assertEquals(42L, …)` runs only under `RUN_DEVIATIONS`; otherwise a regression-guard
`assertEquals(0L, …)` runs. (See §11.)

### 9.5 `RTN16f1` — malformed `recover` key degrades gracefully
`recover = "this-is-not-valid-json!!!"`. Asserts the client still connects normally with a fresh
identity, **no** `recover`/`resume` query params, and exactly one connection attempt — i.e. a bad key
is logged and ignored, not fatal.

### 9.6 `RTN16j` — `recover` instantiates channels with their serials (RTN16i too)
Recovery key carries three channels (incl. Unicode). Asserts each `channels.get(name).properties.
channelSerial` matches the key, that the channels are **NOT auto-attached** (state INITIALIZED —
RTN16i), and that a manual `attach()` sends an ATTACH frame carrying the recovered serial (verified
via `awaitNextMessageFromClient()`).

**What this test teaches about the infra:** callback vs await styles side by side, `FakeClock`-driven
SUSPENDED, `sendToClient` for server frames, `events`/`awaitNextMessageFromClient` for inspecting
client output, and the env-gated deviation pattern.

## 10. Walkthrough: the Proxy Test (`AuthReauthTest`)

**File:** `uts/.../realtime/integration/proxy/AuthReauthTest.kt`
**Tier:** Proxy integration (real sandbox + uts-proxy).
**Spec points:** RTN22 (server-initiated re-authentication) and RTC8a (the client sends an AUTH
frame with renewed auth details). Unit-test counterparts: `server_initiated_reauth_test.md`,
`realtime_authorize.md`.

### 10.1 Suite setup/teardown
```kotlin
@TestInstance(TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)   // one instance, so @BeforeAll can be non-static
class AuthReauthTest {
    @BeforeAll fun setUpAll() = runBlocking {
        ProxyManager.ensureProxy()                // download+launch proxy if needed
        app = SandboxApp.create()                 // provision a real sandbox app
    }
    @AfterAll fun tearDownAll() = runBlocking { if (::app.isInitialized) app.delete() }
}
```

### 10.2 The test, step by step
1. **Create a session with no rules** — the fault will be injected *imperatively* later (late
   injection — the connect handshake runs against the real server unmodified):
   ```kotlin
   val session = ProxySession.create(rules = emptyList())
   ```
2. **Auth via `authCallback`** — the spec generates a JWT from the sandbox key; the idiomatic
   ably-java equivalent is a locally-signed `TokenRequest` from the same key (no external JWT
   library). A counter records how many times the callback is invoked:
   ```kotlin
   val tokenSigner = AblyRest(app.defaultKey)
   val authCallback = Auth.TokenCallback { params ->
       authCallbackCount.incrementAndGet()
       tokenSigner.auth.createTokenRequest(params, null)
   }
   ```
3. **Build the client through the proxy** and connect (JSON stays on so the proxy can inspect
   frames):
   ```kotlin
   val client = TestRealtimeClient {
       this.authCallback = authCallback
       connectThroughProxy(session)
       autoConnect = false
   }
   client.connect()
   awaitState(client, ConnectionState.connected, 15.seconds)
   ```
4. **Snapshot identity** — `connection.id` and the callback count, and assert the callback already
   ran ≥ 1 (initial auth).
5. **Start recording state changes**, then **inject a server-initiated AUTH** (protocol action 17)
   imperatively — simulating Ably asking the client to re-authenticate:
   ```kotlin
   session.triggerAction(mapOf("type" to "inject_to_client",
                               "message" to mapOf("action" to 17)))
   ```
6. **Wait for the re-auth round-trip** with `pollUntil { stateChanges.size > 1 }` (real network, so
   poll — don't sleep).
7. **Assertions** prove RTN22 + RTC8a:
   - `authCallback` was invoked **again** (count incremented) → re-auth was triggered.
   - Connection is still **CONNECTED** and `connection.id` is **unchanged** → re-auth does not
     reconnect.
   - **No** transitions away from CONNECTED were recorded.
   - The **proxy event log** contains a client→server **AUTH frame (action 17) carrying non-null
     `auth` details** (RTC8a) — verified by filtering `session.getLog()`.
8. **Nested teardown** in `finally`: close the client and wait for CLOSED, then always close the
   session and the token signer.

**What this test teaches about the infra:** `ProxyManager.ensureProxy` + `SandboxApp` setup,
`connectThroughProxy`, **late imperative fault injection** via `triggerAction`, real-network waiting
with `pollUntil`, and **proxy-log assertions** as the primary verification (`getLog()` →
filter by `type`/`direction`/`message.action`).

## 11. Deviations: when the SDK disagrees with the spec

`uts/.../io/ably/lib/deviations.md` is the single catalogue of every place the ably-java SDK behaves
differently from the features spec, discovered during translation. Each entry records: the **spec
point**, **what the spec requires**, **what the SDK does**, the **root cause** (file/function, where
known), the **workaround in tests**, and the **affected tests**.

The mechanism (from [`writing-derived-tests.md`](https://github.com/ably/specification/blob/main/uts/docs/writing-derived-tests.md)): the test keeps the **spec-correct** assertion but
gates it behind the `RUN_DEVIATIONS` env var, with a regression-guard assertion for the SDK's actual
behaviour running by default. Normal runs stay green; `RUN_DEVIATIONS=1` turns the failing assertions
on so the gap is reproducible and the test flips automatically once the SDK is fixed.

Current entries relevant to the two tests:

| Spec point | Gist | Touches |
|------------|------|---------|
| **RTN16f** | SDK resets `msgSerial` to 0 on connect even with `recover`; spec says preserve it (42). | `ConnectionRecoveryTest` (§9.4) — `assertEquals(42L,…)` gated, `assertEquals(0L,…)` default guard. |
| **RTN16g2** | Spec's fatal error 50000/500 isn't fatal to the SDK (`isFatalError()` needs code 40000–49999 or status < 500); also `send_to_client_and_close` races the FAILED transition. | `ConnectionRecoveryTest` (§9.2) — uses 40000/400 + plain `sendToClient`. |
| **RTL13b** | `ATTACHING → SUSPENDED` via `realtimeRequestTimeout` not implemented for channel attach. | various channel tests (not the two here). |
| **RTL13c** | `channelRetryTimeout` not cancelled when the connection leaves CONNECTED. | various channel tests; assertions gated behind `RUN_DEVIATIONS`. |

> These deviations are **valuable output**, not failures — each one is a precise, reproducible bug
> report the SDK team can act on, and the gated test becomes the acceptance test for the fix.

---

## 12. How to Run the Tests

```bash
# All UTS tests (unit + proxy). Proxy suites download/launch the proxy automatically.
./gradlew :uts:test

# Just the unit test class:
./gradlew :uts:test --tests "io.ably.lib.realtime.unit.connection.ConnectionRecoveryTest"

# Just the proxy test class (needs network access to the sandbox + GitHub for the proxy binary):
./gradlew :uts:test --tests "io.ably.lib.realtime.integration.proxy.AuthReauthTest"

# Turn on the spec-correct (currently failing) deviation assertions:
RUN_DEVIATIONS=1 ./gradlew :uts:test --tests "*ConnectionRecoveryTest*"

# Run proxy tests against a locally built proxy instead of a GitHub release:
./gradlew :uts:test -Duts.proxy.localPath=/path/to/uts-proxy            # or .tar.gz
#   (equivalently: export UTS_PROXY_LOCAL_PATH=/path/to/uts-proxy)
```

Notes:
- `ProxyManager` **advises** running proxy suites single-fork (`maxParallelForks = 1`) because they
  share the control port (10100). This is not currently set in `uts/build.gradle.kts`; it isn't
  exercised yet because there is only one proxy test class.
- Proxy/sandbox tests need outbound network (sandbox + GitHub releases on first run; the binary is
  then cached under `~/.cache/uts-proxy/`).
- Before pushing, run the project's static-analysis gate (from `CLAUDE.md`):
  `./gradlew checkWithCodenarc checkstyleMain checkstyleTest` — Checkstyle is Java-only and easy to
  miss; remember **no star imports**.

## 13. Quick Reference / Cheat-Sheet

**The two seams that make unit tests possible** (`DebugOptions`):
`webSocketEngineFactory` (WS), `httpEngine` (HTTP), `clock` (time).

**Build a unit-test client:**
```kotlin
val mock = MockWebSocket { onConnectionAttempt = { it.respondWithSuccess(CONNECTED_MESSAGE) } }
val client = TestRealtimeClient { autoConnect = false; install(mock) }
client.connect(); awaitState(client, ConnectionState.connected)
```

**Build a proxy-test client:**
```kotlin
ProxyManager.ensureProxy(); val app = SandboxApp.create()
val session = ProxySession.create(rules = emptyList())
val client = TestRealtimeClient { authCallback = …; connectThroughProxy(session); autoConnect = false }
```

**Server→client (mock):** `sendToClient` (stays open) · `sendToClientAndClose` (DISCONNECTED /
fatal ERROR) · `simulateDisconnect` (1006 drop).

**Inspect what the SDK did:** `mock.events` (unit) · `session.getLog()` (proxy).

**Wait (never sleep):** `awaitState` · `awaitChannelState` · `pollUntil { … }` · `FakeClock.advance(…)`.

**Protocol action numbers** (used in rules & log assertions): CONNECTED=4, DISCONNECTED=6, ERROR=9,
ATTACH=10, ATTACHED=11, DETACH=12, DETACHED=13, **AUTH=17**.

**Test ID format:** `<category>/<spec-point>/<descriptive-name>-<n>` →
`@UTS realtime/proxy/RTN22/server-initiated-reauth-0`.

**The decision tree when a translated test fails:** spec wrong → fix test + record UTS spec error;
translation wrong → fix test; SDK non-compliant → gate spec-correct assertion behind `RUN_DEVIATIONS`
and record in `deviations.md`.

## 14. Appendix A: Request-Flow Diagrams

### A.1 Unit test — mocked WebSocket (no network)

A unit test installs `MockWebSocket` into `DebugOptions.webSocketEngineFactory`. The SDK believes it
is talking to a real socket; in fact every byte is intercepted by the mock and surfaced to the test.

(The HTTP path is identical in shape: `MockHttpClient` → `DebugOptions.httpEngine` →
`MockHttpEngine` → `PendingConnection` then `PendingRequest`, with `respondWith(status, body)`.)

### A.2 Proxy integration test — real backend through the fault-injecting proxy

A proxy test uses the **real** SDK transport but points its host/port at the local `uts-proxy`
process, which forwards to the Ably sandbox and can inject faults on command.

```

**Why two channels to the proxy?** The **data plane** (the SDK's ws/http traffic on
`session.proxyPort`) is separate from the **control plane** (the test's REST calls on
`CONTROL_PORT = 10100` to create sessions, add rules, trigger actions, read the log). The SDK never
sees the control plane; the test never speaks the data plane directly.

|------|--------------------|------|
| `ProxyManager.kt` | `object ProxyManager`: `ensureProxy(timeoutMs)`, `stopProxy()`, `CONTROL_PORT=10100`, `sandboxRealtimeHost`, `sandboxRestHost`; pinned `PROXY_VERSION=v0.3.0` + per-arch checksums; `uts.proxy.localPath` override | Downloads/verifies/launches the `uts-proxy` binary; one shared process per run. |
| `ProxySession.kt` | `class ProxySession` (`create(rules,port,timeoutMs,realtimeHost,restHost)`, `addRules`, `triggerAction`, `getLog(): List<Event>`, `close`, `sessionId`, `proxyPort`, `proxyHost`); `data class Event`; `typealias ProxyRule`; rule builders `wsConnectRule`/`wsFrameToClientRule`/`wsFrameToServerRule`/`httpRequestRule`; `ClientOptionsBuilder.connectThroughProxy(session)` | Typed client for the proxy control REST API + client wiring. |
| `SandboxApp.kt` | `class SandboxApp` (`create()`, `delete()`, `appId`, `defaultKey`, `keys`) | Provisions/tears down a throwaway sandbox app from `ably-common`'s `test-app-setup.json`. |

### B.3 Shared helpers & tests

| File | Key public surface | Role |
|------|--------------------|------|
| `io/ably/lib/Utils.kt` | `awaitState(client,target,timeout=5s)`, `awaitChannelState(channel,target,timeout=5s)`, `pollUntil(timeout=15s,interval=100ms){ }` | Wall-clock coroutine waits; listener registered before state check. |
| `io/ably/lib/types/Utils.kt` | `ConnectionDetails { }` builder | DSL sugar for building `ConnectionDetails` in tests. |
| `realtime/unit/connection/ConnectionRecoveryTest.kt` | 6 `@Test`s: RTN16g/g1, RTN16g2, RTN16k, RTN16f, RTN16f1, RTN16j | Unit tier — connection recovery (mocked WS, FakeClock, env-gated deviations). |
| `realtime/integration/proxy/AuthReauthTest.kt` | 1 `@Test` (two `@UTS`: RTN22, RTC8a) | Proxy tier — server-initiated re-authentication. |
| `deviations.md` | RTN16f, RTN16g2, RTL13b, RTL13c | Catalogue of SDK-vs-spec divergences. |

> **Coverage note:** at the time of writing, the `uts/` module contains exactly **two test classes**
> (**7** `@Test` methods total: 6 in `ConnectionRecoveryTest` + 1 in `AuthReauthTest`). The infrastructure under
> `uts/infra/` and `test/helper/` is built out far beyond what these two tests exercise (full HTTP
> mock, all four rule builders, REST proxy wiring, etc.), anticipating the broader UTS coverage
> catalogued in [`completion-status.md`](https://github.com/ably/specification/blob/main/uts/docs/completion-status.md).
