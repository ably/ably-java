## [v1.2.14](https://github.com/ably/ably-java/tree/v1.2.14)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/ably/ably-java/compare/v1.2.13...v1.2.14)

We've made some changes to JDK and Android API Level minimum requirements in this release,
which might cause problems for those with very old build toolchains,
or application projects with really permissive minimum runtime requirements:

- Java source and target compatibility level increased from 1.7 to **1.8**
- Android minimum SDK API Level increased from 16 to **19 (4.4 KitKat)**

We've also fixed an oversight in our REST support whereby it previously was not possible to fully release resources
consumed by the background thread pool used for HTTP operations, neither explicitly nor passively via GC.
This was most noticeably a problem for applications which created several client instances during the lifespan of
their application process.

**Fixed bugs:**

- NoSuchMethodError in ably-android for API lower than 24 [\#802](https://github.com/ably/ably-java/issues/802), fixed by [\#808](https://github.com/ably/ably-java/pull/808) ([KacperKluka](https://github.com/KacperKluka))

- Minimum API Level supported for Android is 19 \(KitKat, v.4.4\) [\#804](https://github.com/ably/ably-java/pull/804) ([QuintinWillison](https://github.com/QuintinWillison))

**Merged pull requests:**

- Increase minimum JRE version to 1.8 [\#805](https://github.com/ably/ably-java/pull/805) ([QuintinWillison](https://github.com/QuintinWillison))

## [v1.2.0](https://github.com/ably/ably-java/tree/v1.2.0) (2020-06-08)

Adds the capability to subscribe to a channel in delta mode.

Subscribing to a channel in delta mode enables [delta compression](https://www.ably.io/documentation/realtime/channels/channel-parameters/deltas). This is a way for a client to subscribe to a channel so that message payloads sent contain only the difference (ie the delta) between the present message and the previous message on the channel.
