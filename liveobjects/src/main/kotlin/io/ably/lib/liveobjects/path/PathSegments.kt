 * Dot-delimited path <-> segment list conversions. A dot inside a segment is escaped as `\.`

 *
 * Root convention: the root PathObject stores the empty string, which represents ZERO segments
 * (RTPO4c) - unlike ably-js, which stores segment arrays and never parses a stored path. Every
 * helper below therefore treats an empty *stored base path* as zero segments via [parseStored];
 * [parse] itself is only ever given user-supplied sub-paths (where "" means one empty segment,
 * matching ably-js `at("")`) or non-empty stored paths.
