/**
 * A lazy, path-based reference into the LiveObjects graph rooted at the channel's root
 * {@code LiveMap}.
 *
 * <p>A {@code PathObject} stores a path as an ordered list of string segments and
 * resolves it against the local object graph each time a terminal method is called;
 * the freshly resolved value is the sole basis for that call's result. Resolution is
 * best-effort: the value at a path may change between two calls (e.g. between
 * {@link #exists()} and a subsequent write) as updates from other clients are applied.
 *
 * <p>When the path does not resolve, or resolves to a type the called method does not
 * apply to, read operations degrade gracefully - returning {@code null} or an empty
 * result - whereas write operations fail with an {@code AblyException} (code 92005 if
 * the path does not resolve, 92007 on a type mismatch). All terminal operations
 * additionally validate the access/write API preconditions and fail with an
 * {@code AblyException} if those are not satisfied.
 *
 * <p>This base type exposes only the methods whose behaviour is independent of the
 * resolved type; map and counter reads/writes are partitioned onto the sub-types
 * (RTTS3e). Use the {@code as*} helpers to obtain a sub-type view without type
 * validation, e.g. {@code pathObject.asLiveMap().at("a.b.c")} (RTTS3g). The spec's
 * {@code compact} is not exposed; {@link #compactJson()} is the supported equivalent
 * (RTTS3f).
