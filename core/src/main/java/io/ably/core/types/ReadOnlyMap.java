 * Exposes a subset of the Map interface, providing read only access only, removing mutating interfaces.
 * Used in the Ably API where we have previously overexposed the full Map interface, providing a
 * level of acceptable support for users who had relied upon this overexposure for valid reasons
 * including testing and runtime inspection (e.g. iterating channels, counting channels, etc..).
 *
 * Developers should not rely upon any methods in this interface as they will eventually
 * be remove from the Ably API, after a period of deprecation.
